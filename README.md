# CreateREADME

## Description

* My motivation for this project was to have an easy accessible way to create a Readme file for my programing needs

* I built this program for the same reasons I was motivated to create it to help myself with creating a Read me i have a template saved but this program is much simpler,
and easier to use

* The problem it mainly solves is to create a Read me based on a user criteria with ease, the problem it solves specifically for me is that it saves time.  it is much faster
to use this code to create a Read me then to create one by hand, this program will save me time with future projects.

* What i learned during this project/program was the use of the when function when writing the inquirer, it works very similar to an if statement when paired with the confirm
type input.  What i also learned was the use of continuously adding to one variable, before writing this code i was a little confused as to how i was gonna add all the backtick string
files to generateMarkdown function.  After a bit of searching on the internet and asking my T.A i learned you can just add to a variable like i did within the function.  I did not
I think this was possible with strings. I knew you could do it with numbers so I think it's definitely something I learned and is useful
